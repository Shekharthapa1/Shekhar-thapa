    "Data science is the process of drawing useful insights from raw data using a combination of different components such as domain expertise, knowledge of maths and statistics, programming skills, and machine learning models. The insights are later translated by business users and key decision-makers into tangible business value                                                            Data science has turned out to be one of the most popular tech fields in the 21st century. This is because almost every industry, including healthcare, travel, automobile, defense, and manufacturing, has applications associated with data science. These wide applications and increased demand for maximizing business value have led to the development of various data science tools.                                                                                                                                 Data science is a field that involves using statistical and computational techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data. It encompasses a wide range of tasks, including data cleaning and preparation, data visualization, statistical modeling, machine learning, and more. Data scientists use these techniques to discover patterns and trends in data, make predictions, and support decision-making. They may work with a variety of data types, including structured data (such as numbers and dates in a spreadsheet) and unstructured data (such as text, images, or audio). Data science is used in a wide range of industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and more."
